# NC News Seeding

To create the .env files I went into my northcoders-news-be folder and clicked on new file to create two seperate .env files which are .env.development and .env.test. 

The value I need inside the .env.development file is PGDATABASE=nc_news, this will allow developer to connect to the nc_news database locally.

The value I need inside the .env.test file is PGDATABASE=nc_news_test, this will allow the developer to connect to the nc_news_test database locally.
